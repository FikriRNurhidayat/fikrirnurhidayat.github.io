Hello, Fikri's here! ðŸ‘‹

This my introductory post to start my blogging journey on this website.
Why do I want to start blogging?
I don't know, perhaps I really want to express my self as human being.

#### Who am I?

I'm just as it said in the homepage,
*Just an ordinary human being*, not special at all.
But, if you're asking me, what my job is,
that I'll gladly answer that I'm a software engineer.
Specifically, **Backend Engineer**
at <a href="https://binaracademy.com" target="_blank">Binar Academy</a>.

#### What should you expect about this blog?

Just simply blogpost about my daily drive on my field,
like GNU/Linux stuff, coding stuff,
and probably some phlosophical idea that I happen to read.
Also, perhaps rant about something that I don't like etc.
But mostly I'll focus on GNU/Linux topics.

I've been tinkering around on GNU/Linux and FOSS a lot lately,
so perhaps I can share my journey during the process.
For example, patching
<a href="https://dwm.suckless.org" target="_blank">suckless's dwm</a>.
Or maybe, writing configuration for
<a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty" target="_blank">Alacritty</a>.
And some
<a href="https://archlinux.org" target="_blank">Arch Linux</a>.
build that I've done. Yes, I use Arch btw ðŸ™‚.

#### What now?

I don't know, find something else that might interest you. But, here's picture of my cat.
She's pregnant by the way at the time when I'm writing this.
