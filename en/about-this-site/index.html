<p>
I am a programmer from <a href="https://binaracademy.com">Binar Academy</a>, an edutech company. As an employee who cares about company's vision, I love to share my knowledge, experience, and whatever I know, either it's on technology field, or other field of expertise.
</p>

<p>
Because of that, I want to build this site. This site will be my vessel to share my knowledge, experience, and my point of view about this world. I believe that by sharing whatever I have, I indirectly contribute to make better education, and help this world to progress to be better in healthy common sense.
</p>

<p>
Every content on this site is all my work. Of course, I'll cite every information that I learn from other people, nobody starts from scratch.

<h2 id="org5d7f756">Content on This Sites</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5d7f756">
<p>
This site will contain my writing about the following topics:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Computer</li>
<li>GNU/Linux</li>
<li>Free and Open Source Software</li>
<li>Programming</li>
<li>Emacs</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I happen to know about those topics, and I really love it as well. There's a lot of stuff that can be talked about, written about those topics. Take emacs as example, I wrote this website just using emacs, this writing is also written in emacs with <code>.org</code> as format. This writing then converted into HTML by emacs. I can even export this writing as PDF.
</p>

<p>
I hope that you catch the outline of what I'm going to write in the future.

<h2 id="org61ddfdd">How Often Will I Write?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org61ddfdd">
<p>
Honestly, I don't know. I'm an amateur writer. I love writing, but that doesn't necessarily mean that I can write a lot, since I have another issue that I need to face. It's laziness.
</p>

<p>
I'll try to write every month, but I can't promise. Even, I have a tedency to delete my writing when I think it was not good enough, just like all of my writing ont this website.

<h2 id="org8d5e0bf">What Built This Website</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8d5e0bf">
<p>
Just as I said upfront, this website was built using emacs. I use <a href="https://simplecss.org/">Simple.css</a> for the UI, but that can be changed in the future.
