    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <h5>Sep 11, 2021</h5>

    <p>Hello, Fikriâ€™s here! ðŸ‘‹</p>

<p>This my introductory post to start my blogging journey on this website.
Why do I want to start blogging?
I donâ€™t know, perhaps I really want to express my self as human being.</p>

<h4 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h4>

<p>Iâ€™m just as it said in the homepage,
<em>Just an ordinary human being</em>, not special at all.
But, if youâ€™re asking me, what my job is,
that Iâ€™ll gladly answer that Iâ€™m a software engineer.
Specifically, <strong>Backend Engineer</strong>
at <a href="https://binaracademy.com" target="_blank">Binar Academy</a>.</p>

<h4 id="what-should-you-expect-about-this-blog">What should you expect about this blog?</h4>

<p>Just simply blogpost about my daily drive on my field,
like GNU/Linux stuff, coding stuff,
and probably some phlosophical idea that I happen to read.
Also, perhaps rant about something that I donâ€™t like etc.
But mostly Iâ€™ll focus on GNU/Linux topics.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been tinkering around on GNU/Linux and FOSS a lot lately,
so perhaps I can share my journey during the process.
For example, patching
<a href="https://dwm.suckless.org" target="_blank">sucklessâ€™s dwm</a>.
Or maybe, writing configuration for
<a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty" target="_blank">Alacritty</a>.
And some
<a href="https://archlinux.org" target="_blank">Arch Linux</a>.
build that Iâ€™ve done. Yes, I use Arch btw ðŸ™‚.</p>

<h4 id="what-now">What now?</h4>

<p>I donâ€™t know, find something else that might interest you. But, hereâ€™s picture of my cat.
Sheâ€™s pregnant by the way at the time when Iâ€™m writing this.</p>
