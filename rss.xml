        <description><![CDATA[<p>
For the last few months, I felt burnout, even today, when I'm writing this post. I feel like I don't achieve anything meaningful in my life, even though I can actually do that. I'm not really motivated to do anything meaningful, instead I'm slowly be more lazier day by days and watch Youtube all days.
</p>

<p>
I don't think this is ideal for me. I'm 24 years old right now, I'm actually only have 1 year left before my frontal cortex fully developed, and what I'm doing right now is actually pretty mundane. I work at boring job where everything is just about the money. Sure, having job is something that I can appreciate in this day and age, but I don't feel the fulfillment. I feel like I'm not going through power process enough, all I'm doing is a surrogate activities.
</p>

<p>
I actually have a lot of plans to make something meaningful, but I never really try to start working on it, because of my laziness.
</p>

<p>
Aside from all of that, I feel good in some ways. I spent time and money with my family which is good, it means I don't work for nothing. And I also spent more time with my fiancé.
</p>

<p>
I've been playing a lot for the past two weeks since I bought the new PS5, even though the one who puts a lot of hours into are my brothers. Playing some Doom Eternal there as well, because why not. Well, playing on Steam Deck is way much comfortable since the control is better there than the PS5 Dualshock Controller. I also played my favourite game when I was a kid, Crash Team Racing: Nitro Fueled. It was a ton of funs, turns out I didn't finish it fully when I was a kid. I learned a ton of stuff that I never do when I was a kid, such as power sliding, etc.
</p>

<p>
I know it seems random, but today I also found out that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Sawyer">Josh Swayer</a> (Project Director &amp; Lead Designer of Fallout: New Vegas) is actually come from History Majors, which my fiancé is currently studying at. She also feels the same way as I am, she felt burnout from her thesis work. This sparks a lot of thoughts for projects that I want to do, and I also can involve her in that project.
</p>

<p>
About the programming stuff, I tried to learn Guile Scheme again, and found out that Guile Website is actually built using <a href="https://dthompson.us/projects/haunt.html">Haunt</a>, maybe I'll migrate my website to use haunt in the future.

        <title>Steam Deck Experience</title>

Steam Deck is a handheld gaming device manufactured by Valve. In this post, I'll share my experience of using it.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-where-was-i-when-it-was-released" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="where-was-i-when-it-was-released">Where was I when it was released?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
In late 2021, I followed any information regarding Steam Deck, since it is very interesing for me because it runs on Steam OS with the codename Holo which is a branch of Arch Linux (I use it, btw). I really want to buy that device, but sadly at that time, I don't have the financial budget to do so.
</p>

<p>
Regardless I was able to buy Steam Deck or not, at least I still get the benefit its existence. Steam Proton is now very well improved, I can run most of the game that are available on the Steam Library, of course the game <b>MUST</b> be compatible with my laptop tho. I can even run <b>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (Special Edition)</b> on very low setting without any issue.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-finally-i-bought-steam-deck" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="finally-i-bought-steam-deck">Finally, I bought Steam Deck!</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
In late March of 2023, I bought Steam Deck, because I have the financial capability to do so, and I'm so bored at that time. I bought the 512GB variant, because I think the price is not that bad. The original price from Valve is <b>$649</b> which is roughly <b>Rp 9.697.001,05</b> in my currency.
</p>

<p>
But, since I live in the Third World Country, I just don't order it directly from Valve, but instead, I bought it via Tokopedia Seller called <b>Tech Gadgets Store</b>. It's a little bit pricy, but I think it's worth tho, it's <b>Rp 11.474.000,-</b>. I wait for like 3-4 days after I bought it from Tokopedia, I hate Sicepat.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-it-s-gaming-time" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="it-s-gaming-time">It's gaming time</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
When it was arrived, I immediately install bunch of games on my library, here's the following games that I installed immediately:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Fallout: New Vegas</li>
<li>Slipstream</li>
<li>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (Special Edition)</li>
<li>Resident Evil 4 (Remake)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Fallout: New Vegas ran flawlessly on Very High setting, it was overall better experience than running it on my Laptop. I never see Fallout: New Vegas be that good. Slipstream ran perfectly. Then, Skyrim also runs OK, but I have to tweak the setting so I can get 40 FPS, I set it on High setting. And, Resident Evil runs OK at Low Setting, I can get stable 40 FPS.
</p>

<p>
Days later, I impulsively bought bunch of games to try it out, and also the game that I really want to play for years:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Doom Eternal</li>
<li>Resident Evil 3 (Remake)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Both of those games run at solid 60 FPS at High Setting.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-the-battery-life-is-bad" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="the-battery-life-is-bad">The battery life is bad</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
With that price, you can't get everything right? The only downside of Steam Deck is its Battery Life. I can only reach 1 hour or if I'm lucky I can get 2 hours of battery life while playing the Doom Eternal.
</p>

<p>
To be honest, it's not a big deal for me, since I usually play it on a desk with charging station in it.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-does-it-support-mouse-and-keyboard" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="does-it-support-mouse-and-keyboard">Does it support mouse and keyboard?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Of course, but I don't use mouse and keyboard at the time, since I plan to buy Steam Deck Docking Station, so I can get optimal Gaming setup with it. To be honest, I don't really need it right now, the controls on Steam Deck is pretty good tho, and it supports Gyro controls.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-of-course-i-need-mouse-and-keyboard-for-desktop-mode" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="of-course-i-need-mouse-and-keyboard-for-desktop-mode">Of course I need mouse and keyboard for Desktop mode</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
So, Steam Deck came with two modes by default, the Gaming Mode, and Desktop Mode. Gaming Mode is the default mode when you launch Steam Deck. It basically the Steam UI where you can launch your games.
</p>

<p>
Desktop Mode is the generic GNU/Linux Desktop. Steam OS uses KDE as the Desktop Environment. You can switch to Desktop Mode by pressing <code>STEAM</code> button, then choose Exit then choose Desktop Mode. It's actually a fully fledge GNU/Linux desktop, you can do anything with it. Even in the future, I'm planning to play around a bit on the Desktop Mode. But, for now, let's not do that, since I don't have the Steam Deck Docking Station yet.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-was-it-worth-your-money" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="was-it-worth-your-money">Was it worth your money?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
With that price tho, I can say it's worth your money. You have fully fledge Gaming PC on your handheld. And the best part is, you don't have to run Windows to play most of Steam Game. So, I can finally say Goodbye to Windows forever.
